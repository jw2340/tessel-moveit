# Tessel Move It

Tessel Move It is a web app that tracks user's movement with an accelerometer module. When we are working, we often
forget to get up and move around. This app encourages users to move around every now and then. Depending on how much the 
user moves in a time period, the app will either play a motivational message reminding the user to get up and move or play a
celebratory song for moving around!
